Code for simulations of our paper (in revision): "An approximate stochastic optimal control framework to simulate nonlinear neuro-musculoskeletal models in the presence of noise"


You will need to install CasADi (https://web.casadi.org/) to solve the defined optimal control problems.
 - 'mumps' is the standard linear solver used within IPOPT optionssol.ipopt.linear_solver = 'mumps'
